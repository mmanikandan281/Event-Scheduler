Event Scheduler
A user-friendly desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for scheduling and visualizing events on a graphical timeline.
Overview
Event Scheduler allows users to manage daily events with a clean interface, featuring a visual timeline for easy planning. Users can add, edit, and remove events, check for time conflicts, and save schedules to a text file. The application uses pastel colors for event visualization and supports a time range from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.
Features

Event Management: Add, edit, or remove events with activity names and start/end times (HH:MM format).
Visual Timeline: Displays events on a 12-hour timeline (8:00 AM to 8:00 PM) with pastel-colored event blocks.
Overlap Detection: Prevents scheduling conflicts by checking for overlapping events.
Save to File: Export your schedule to a text file for easy sharing or backup.
Modern UI: Styled with a clean, modern look using Tkinter's 'clam' theme and custom button designs.
Responsive Design: Timeline adjusts dynamically to window resizing.

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
Tkinter (included with standard Python installations)
No additional external libraries required

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-scheduler.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd event-scheduler


(Optional) Verify dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Tkinter is typically included with Python, so no additional dependencies are usually needed.

Usage

Run the application:python src/event_scheduler.py


Add an Event:
Enter the activity name, start time, and end time in the "Add New Event" section (use HH:MM format, e.g., 09:30).
Click "Add Event" to include it in the schedule.


Edit an Event:
Select an event from the "Event List."
Click "‚úèÔ∏è Edit Event" to populate the input fields with the event details.
Modify the details and click "Update Event."


Remove an Event:
Select an event from the "Event List."

Save Schedule:
Click "üíæ Save to File" to export the schedule as a text file.


View the timeline in the "Event Timeline" section, which updates automatically.

Example
Add an event:

Activity: "Team Meeting"
Start Time: 10:00
End Time: 11:30

The event appears on the timeline as a pastel-colored block and in the event list as "10:00 - 11:30 : Team Meeting."
